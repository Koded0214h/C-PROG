# Learning C Programming: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my C programming journey! ðŸš€

This repository documents my progress as I learn and practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the C programming language. Here, you'll find my implementations, projects, and notes as I explore core computer science concepts.

## Why C and DSA?
C is a foundational language that offers deep insight into how computers work. Mastering DSA in C helps me build efficient, robust programs and prepares me for advanced topics in computer science.

## What's Inside

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort
  - Directory: `sorting algorithms/`
- **Abstract Data Types (ADT):**
  - Stacks and Queues (in arrays and linked lists)
  - Directory: `ADT/`
- **Array Operations:**
  - Searching, Sorting, Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, 2D Arrays
  - Directory: `arrays/`
- **Projects:**
  - Example: Task Scheduler
  - Directory: `projects/`
- **Assignments & Learning Exercises:**
  - Practice problems and notes
  - Directories: `assignment/`, `learn/`

## How to Use
Feel free to browse the code, suggest improvements, or use these examples for your own learning. If you're also learning C or DSA, let's connect and share knowledge!
